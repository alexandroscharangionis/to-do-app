To-do app for The Odin Project.

The goal of this app was to develop something slightly more complex and use everything that was learned in the curriculum's previous chapters:

Functions, various array and string methods, DOM manipulation, ES6 Classes and Modules, Webpack and basic use of local-storage with JSON.
